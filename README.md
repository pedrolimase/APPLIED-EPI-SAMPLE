# On the use of High-Flow Nasal Cannula in Intensive Care Units in two Hospitals in (Redacted)

## Project description

This report is the result of a statistical analysis project in which I analyzed the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in two hospitals (A and B). The main goal of the study was to determine whether the HFNC remotion protocol was associated to weaning failure, considering each hospital used a different protocol. There was also an interest in the hospital and PICU stay and HFNC usage times. Before anything, I explain some important concepts that the client may not be acquainted with. Then I start with reading, cleaning and transforming the data using various `tidyverse` packages and `janitor`. Using `gtsummary`, I proceeded with a descriptive analyis comparing each patient characteristic according to hospitals, in which I also include univariate tests of association. Finally, I used some multivariate generalized linear models (logistic and gamma regression) to estimate the effect of the protocol/hospital in some variables of interest adjusted for possible confounder variables (weeks of pregnancy and sex). Their assumptions were assessed using the `performance` package that is part of the `easystats` framework.
