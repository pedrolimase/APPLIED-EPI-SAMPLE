I am writing to express my interest in joining the R Instructor Roster at Applied Epi. While I have not yet had the opportunity to collaborate directly with your team, I have benefited immensely from *The Epidemiologist R Handbook* throughout my academic journey. The resources provided by Applied Epi's team of collaborators have significantly enhanced my ability to use R for statistical analysis in clinical research, and I deeply admire Applied Epi's principles and values and the impact you've had on epidemiology and on other several communities.

My academic background is in Statistics and I've recently completed my bachelor's degree. Throughout my journey, I participated several projects that helped me developed my skills: internships, a study group in causal inference, statistical consulting and teaching assistance. In my consulting role, I worked closely with clinical researchers and fellow students, providing reproducible statistical analyses and reports using `R`'s rich ecosystem, while also communicating complex statistical information to non-technical audiences.

I am confident that my strong foundation in Statistics, my communication and analytical skills, and `R` experience position me well as a candidate for the Assistant Instructor role in intro courses. As I continue to grow, I look forward to the possibility of contributing to more advanced courses as well. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to give back to the R community, while also learning from and collaborating with Applied Epi's team.

I am a native Portuguese speaker fluent in English and I'm based in Bras√≠lia, DF, Brazil (UTC-3). My schedule is flexible schedule and I am open to start right away, both remote and in-person. Thank you for considering my application; I am eager for the opportunity of contributing to your mission.

Sincerely,

Pedro Henrique Lima de Menezes
